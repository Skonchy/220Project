Music Library Project for CS220


Authors: James Jessup & Jake Kowa

Project:  We plan to make a sort of music library that works like Spotify or Pandora.  It will be able to search for a song in the list, play a song, skip a song, go back to a previous song, and add a song to the library.  Also has a queue system for playing song requests.   While not set in stone, the data structures we intend to use would be Double Linked List for the library itself, Queue for playing songs, and Tree for the search system.
